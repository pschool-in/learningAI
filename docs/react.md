## Table

Create a table of data and carry out CRED operations.

prompt 1:

Using ReactJS create a component that displays a table of 10 rows and 4 columns
with sample data. The columns are S.No. , Name, Gender, DOB. Also add required
code to do the CRUD operation on the table. Style the component using
styled-components.

prompt 2:

This is good. Can you merge all styles in single styled-component and represent
in jsx through classname? Please use Indian names. Date should be in the format
dd-mm-yyyy. Make the rows of table selectable. Selected row should have bg color
#edf092. Only selected row should display edit and delete button.
